Key steps I followed:

1. Used git rebase add-echo and git rebase add-reverse on top of master in sequence.

2. Resolved any conflicts carefully, verified functionality.

3. Cleaned up the history with interactive rebase (git rebase -i) to match the expected structure.

4. Pushed the result to my private repo as instructed, without forking.
